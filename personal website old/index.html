					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"The Long Term Ramifications of Fixed-Supply Currencies"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>Following World War I, Americans entered the “Roaring Twenties”. During the war, factory production had increased massively to produce equipment for the military. Following the war, these factories turned from the production of military to consumer goods, leading to an abundance. US President Calvin Coolidge encouraged growth by reducing taxes and regulation leading to further prosperity and production. With a booming economy, individuals felt safe making purchases, having confidence that the growth would continue.
						On October 24th, 1929, the DOW dropped eleven percent and this day would be known as “Black Friday”. For the next decade, the entire US economy stood at a standstill. “Black Friday” signaled a pivot from the growth that had started nearly twenty years previous. The Federal Reserve increased the monetary supply by 240% since 1913, with a 60% increase from 1920–1929 alone (Daughty, 2011). From 1928 to 1931, however, 30% of the money supply was removed by the Federal Reserve creating a deflationary effect. The addition or subtraction of the money supply was not determined by market participants, but rather the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the current and future needs. Economic growth disappeared due to rampant deflation. The factories which had been healthily producing suddenly disappeared along with nearly half of the country’s banks, leaving one in ten citizens unemployed and without savings (Great Depression History). A simple way to think about an economy is with a nod to Newton; an economy in motion tends to stay in motion. Once the economy slows, stops, or reverses, changing this becomes an impossible task. With large supply, the economy continued to crash as deflation took a permanent hold.</p>
						<p>Deflation occurs when the price of goods or services decreases over time, or when a currency has an increase in purchasing power or valuation (Deflation). The word “deflation” itself suggests there is a something being removed from a body or supply. Think of a fully inflated balloon; as air escapes, the balloon will lose pressure and “deflate” back to nothingness. During inflation, spending is incentivized as holding the currency will eventually lead to a decrease in purchasing power as prices rise. During deflation, saving will be incentivized as prices continue to fall in the face of increasing purchasing power. Without a constant flow of money or buying pressure, an economy will begin to deflate over time.</p>
						<p>Natural deflations to supply are absorbed and provide benefit to participants when done at a market-determined rate. For example, the cell phone used by Gordon Gekko in Wall Street (1987) was both large and bulky, costing $3,995 in 1983 (Breselor, 2010). In 2018, when adjusted for inflation, the Motorola DynaTac 8000X would be $10,090.81 (Inflation Calculator). Since then, decreased cost and increased production put cellphones in the hands of citizens around the world. This change in the price of cellphones was deflationary since the price decreased negatively over time. As long as this change is based on market participation, beneficial deflation will be absorbed and provide benefits such as cheaper phones. During the Great Depression, however, prices for products dropped so rapidly that there was a non-existent demand, diminishing profits, hindering production, creating a crushing wave of deflation. Factories and farms were devastated as no profit could be gained from a population with no ability to buy. A wave of bank closings eradicated the savings of citizens across the nation leaving hundreds of thousands of citizens bankrupt. With no savings and no work, any hope of growth rapidly disappeared. The US dollar was no longer a medium of exchange, but only a store of value as scarcity increased and prices decreased.</p>

					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>This article will show:
							<li>Enron’s reconstructed historical price chart</li>
							<li>Technical analysis indicating market turning points regardless of popular fundamental analysis</li>
							<li>Market reversals were detectable with a common indicator; the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD)</li></p>
						<p><b>Introduction</b>
							Constructing a historical chart will show Enron Corporation's price chart contained reversal signals at significant points, information which could have prevented financial losses. Technical analysis provided a clear and unbiased view of the market’s health, though it is impossible to protect from post-hoc bias nearly twenty years later.
							Now synonymous with fraud and corruption, Enron was a major industry leader in energy services for almost two decades. Stock price nearly tripled from $30 to $80 in 2000 while a myriad of shell companies hid billions in debt. Finding themselves further and further in debt, Enron continued to announce growth each quarter.
							With insider’s selling shares long before the collapse was announced, retail traders were left exposed to the reality of the situation, making valuations based on information Enron released. Information asynchronicity makes an understanding the inner workings of a company impossible and makes accurate valuations difficult. Valuations of insiders and market makers will always be visible from a technical standpoint while remaining invisible from a fundamental standpoint.
							To my knowledge, a retroactive examination from a technical standpoint has not been made. The literature on Enron highlights the financial corruption that implicitly removes the responsibility of retail traders although it does nothing to repair the losses.
							Market events are predictable, not random or arbitrary, making them predictive with correct indicators and proper understanding. Examinations like this, to my knowledge, have not previously been made. Historical price data is drawn from data from the University of Missouri-Kansas project page.
							Not the first, most certainly not the last, future companies will follow in Enron’s steps; stock fractal or fraud. Prevention can come from learning from this example. In this case, divergences were visibly and accurately formed, giving of warning beforehand.
							Reversal points are referred to as divergences, which any seasoned trader should be familiar with. Bullish divergences will be referred to as positive divergences, and negative divergences will be referred to as negative divergences.
							</p>
						<p>The market from 12/1/1999 to 6/1/2001 as it contains the most significant movements of ENRON including the highest prices, and where a large part of the inside trading took place. This information was verified by comparing it to infographics. Enron was publicly traded before 1998, but this was the only data set that was publicly obtainable.</p>
						<p>The most violent market movements are often when retail traders and the media are the most involved. Daily charts often contain significant noise, so three-day and weekly charts will also be generated.
							Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) settings: short EMA period of 12, long EMA period of 26, and signal smoothing length of 9. Peerchemist’s FinTA python library allows us to easily generate indicator values from our custom data set. The resulting charts can be seen below.</p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"The “Rich Get Richer” Concept in Proof-of-Stake Systems"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>The “rich get richer” (RGR) concept is applied to many scenarios and is used to describe the concentration of resources by entities who have an “unfair” advantage over those who lack the same resources. In every monetary system, an accumulation of resources can be observed, even in systems as simple as games of Monopoly. However, many frivolously describe the staking process of Peercoin as being a similar mechanic due to the roughly 1% annual returns that exist through the minting process. This is incorrect and must be represented honestly.
							Start by defining the distinction between a “nominal” and “real” value. A “nominal” value as its name (Latin root “nom” means “name”) implies, exists due to a communicative label placed upon such object. For example, prior to the 1970’s a single dollar bill represented “one dollar’s worth” of gold. More importantly, the summation of the physical nature of the one dollar bill was not equivalent to the ounce of gold; solely the ascribed value. There was no physical difference between a one dollar bill and five dollar bill for all intents and purposes. Sparing the discussion of devaluation and inflation, the idea that a visible change in the ink on a piece of paper from a one to a five would inherently change the value must be understood and accepted for a correct understanding. “Real” value of an object comes from a value comparison between two or more objects. Let’s say you are a young child and your parents pay you a dollar a week for doing your chores (making your bed, cleaning your room, etc), and at the end of the week, you get to go to the local dollar store and buy a toy (valued at $1). Your week of work is equivalent to one toy a week and can be represented as $1 for a week’s worth of chores, or one week of chores for one toy, or $1 for a toy, and so on. This system of comparison ties the worth of each piece of the system together, communicating value about each participating piece and its “real” value.</p>
						<p>Now, let’s say the local dollar store changes ownership and is rebranded to the two-dollar store. Now instead of one week of chores, you need two. Your parents graciously double your chore money so the system can be maintained. Now you make $2 a week for one week of chores and are still able to buy one toy. Your income has increased by double, while your purchasing power has remained the same. Put simply, although you are now making $2 instead of $1, which is a nominal increase, the amount of time you are working and what you can buy with that money in its triangular relationship has remained the same, maintaining the real value.
							In most cases, people use this colloquialism to describe a disparity between rich and poor. The difference in the amount of money held by either side is staggering on many occasions, however, this is not a function of an unfair system. During a game of Monopoly, over a number of terms, money is exchanged between parties and eventually, one individual holds the majority of the money while other players each declare bankruptcy. In the real world, this same system appears as few individuals tend to hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, relative to the majority of individuals and is described through the Pareto distribution. However, this Pareto distribution does not solely exist in finance, but also in creative works, including writing, film, visual media, and music. The majority of great works produced in each domain were produced by an extreme minority of individuals. Individuals such as Elvis Presley and Garth Brooks have sold some hundreds of millions of albums while (assuming) the majority of individuals in our daily lives have sold none (Decluttr). This is not an unfair system, but rather the result of specialization and the exchange of Elvis’s time for a skill which was honed to an expert level. Every moment Elvis spent playing guitar was a moment not spent cooking or learning medicine. This opportunity cost presents itself in every situation and dedication to one domain generally leads to specialization and an increase in ability over time.</p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"Platform Choice for Online Communities: Horizontal vs. Vertical"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>Platform chose is one of the most important decisions made as a community manager. In blockchain, many ICOs used a wide number of platforms (Slack, Telegram, Discord, etc) but then found themselves with a community unable to sustain itself. Spreading a community’s user base across too many platforms will inevitably lead to unsustainability. Organic growth is difficult to come by and is often hindered by overuse of platforms that serve the same function.
							My first community began as a Kik group but rapidly gained nearly four thousand members in the span of 48 hours so another option had to be found. Settling on Discord and Reddit, additional Facebook, Steam, TeamSpeak, and Kik groups were created. These results in user attrition through a lack of sustained activity. Proper platform choices from the start will reduce attrition. Choosing the best platform to meet the community’s needs will create the best possible user experience and provide the best environment for organic growth.</p>
						<p><b>Introductory Concepts</b>
							There are two types of platform structures that we will discuss today; horizontal and vertical platforms. These are differentiated by the direction information flows and the form of discussion.
						<b>Vertical Platforms</b>
							Vertical platforms are most easily compared to IRC chats, group texts, and platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, WeChat, and so forth. Each presents information in real time at a rapid pace (instant messaging). The available information is created and consumed by the members active at the time. You can think of these like a perpetual smoker’s circle where members come and go but the circle remains. As communities get large, conversations move faster and discussing complex discussions gets more difficult.
							While these platforms are excellent for high interactivity, rapid response, and rapid information dissemination, most are not efficient for active communities of more than 100 members. Activity in a single channel can rapidly move so quickly that messages get lost or conversations interrupted.
							Note: Discord and Slack fall in the category of vertical platforms, but the allowance for the creation of categories and sub-channels allows for slightly more horizontal discussions. Discord has remained my platform of choice in terms of verticality for this exact reason as it beats out similar platforms such as Rocket.Chat, and as it has remained free, unlike Slack.</p>

							Binary outcomes are simple to model. Margin of victory type predictions take additional effort. Regardless, the outcome of a given prediction relative to the money line of a given market must also be tested. One may bet the favorite, but may find losses during upsets to be damaging.
							For this reason, one must compare the profitability of picks against historical book odds. You can find such betting market data here. This is not a service largely offered at this time and will caused hindrance to the growth of the esports scene.</p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"Peercoin’s Hybrid Chain Solution to Proof-of-Work, Global Scaling, and Environmental Impact"</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>Satoshi Nakamoto’s implementation of hashcash cryptography and verification that backs Bitcoin and many forks has been revolutionary and helped create a massive decentralized and trustless currency ecosystem. This system is called proof-of-work (PoW), and many are relatively familiar with the basics of this process and its underlying mechanisms will only be briefly touched upon. The basic process of mining involves a series of mathematical computations or “guesses” that attempt to determine the answer or “nonce”, to a difficult math question. If the guess is correct, the miner receives a reward from the block plus the fees paid by transactions. These numbers are extremely difficult to guess and have no predictable pattern.
							Miners compete to guess the next block and each correct guess is validated and transmitted to other miners in the network. Each miner’s guessing rate is determined by the amount of computational power of their mining rigs. In the early days, Bitcoins could be mined using central processing units (CPUs), then graphics cards (GPUs), and currently application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs) which are processors built specifically to solve hash based problems. As more Bitcoins are mined, the difficulty of each mathematical problem increases which requires both more guesses and guessing at a higher rate. It is still possible to mine with CPUs or GPUs, although the chances of receiving any reward is slim to non-existent. Those participating in mining must pay the cost of power to run the mining units, which can be offset by the rewards gained from mining. This creates a barrier to entry as finding both cheap power and affording the relatively expensive hardware is increasingly costly. This scarcity of hash power and electricity creates the scarce resource which creates economic competitiveness and security in proof-of-work. Miners must compete to submit valid blocks or else lose out on potential block rewards. More participants and miners increases the security of a chain, decreasing the chance of receiving the reward from the next block.</p>	
						<p>Over time however, the question of scaling mining-based security to a global scale has become an important question. In economies of scale, those who are able to produce or mine at more effective rates will tend to be able to do so in larger quantities and at a cheaper rate over time. As we have seen, large segments of the mining industry have been collected into pools that are primarily responsible for the majority of the mining rewards and security of the chain. Increasing this mining competition to a global scale in theory would include nation based mining pools who are competing against other nations. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin Cash is engaging in a hash war with two factions named ABC and SV. This type of split could eventually be played out in a scenario of say the United States versus China. As block difficulty increases, more mining power will be needed to maintain profitability.</p>

					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple who had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not practicably companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn no other. The family removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
						<p>His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance.

						<p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple who had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not practicably companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn no other. The family removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
