# Motley

If you are an individual with a motley selection of skills and experience, it may be difficult to narrow your resume for employers.  Motley offers you the unique ability to create a full resume then narrow what employers see based on a tagging system.  

Motley was intentionally made with minimal styling so you can customize it to your tastes as needed.  Additionally, the editor.html allows you to make rapid changes and outputs your resume to a JSON file so you can easily update your resume.

Special thanks to @00jacket for his CSS/HTML/emotional support contributions.  We made this in 72 hours, please excuse some sloppy code. 

## Future Plans
