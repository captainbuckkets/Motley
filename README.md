# Motley

![Alt text](/img/default/motley.jpg)

If you are an individual with a motley selection of skills and experience, it may be difficult to narrow your resume for employers.  Motley offers you the unique ability to create a full resume then narrow what employers see based on a tagging system.  

Motley was intentionally made with minimal styling so you can customize it to your tastes as needed.  Additionally, the editor.html allows you to make rapid changes and outputs your resume to a JSON file so you can easily update your resume.

From the editing page, you can change the menu tags to change which options are available on the welcome card.  You can add new elements to your resume using the menu on the right.  You can reorder the elements by dragging using the drag handle on the top left of most elements.

Special thanks to @00jacket for his CSS/HTML/emotional support contributions.  We made this in 72 hours, please excuse some sloppy code.
